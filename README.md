# Machinery_Parts Catalog
This project is a web-based catalog designed for an automotive assembly company that specializes in robotics and industrial machinery. The catalog provides a comprehensive list of machine parts used in the production process, allowing users to browse through different components and select the ones they wish to request a quote for.

Key Features:

	•Dynamic Parts Catalog: Displays a categorized selection of robotics and machinery parts with detailed specifications.
 
	•Quote Request System: Users can select multiple parts, specify the quantity, and generate a quote request directly from the website.
 
	•Automated PDF Generation: Once a quote is requested, a PDF document is automatically created, summarizing the selected parts and quantities.
 
	•Secure Notification System: To ensure confidentiality, the company’s internal team—whose details remain private for security reasons—receives an email notification whenever a new quote request is submitted.
 
	•Admin Dashboard: The company’s team can log into a secure internal portal to view and manage customer quotes efficiently.

Security & Privacy

For security reasons, only part of the project is uploaded to this repository. Certain critical components and configurations are not included to protect company data and maintain confidentiality.

This platform streamlines the quoting process for industrial machinery and robotic components, enhancing efficiency and communication between the company and its clients while ensuring data security.
